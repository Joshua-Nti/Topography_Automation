def moveGCode(in_file, out_file, x_off=None, y_off=None):
    """
    Create a shifted copy of the merged (combined) G-code.

    Goal ðŸŽ¯:
    - Keep purge / intro / warmup stuff at the original XY (usually near origin).
    - Move the actual printed object to a new XY offset (e.g. +100 / +100 mm).

    Trigger logic (same approach that already worked for you):
    1. We watch for the first occurrence of ';LAYER_CHANGE'. After we see it,
       we are now "armed": we know the real print is about to start soon.
       BUT we still do NOT shift yet.

    2. After we're armed, the first movement command (G0 or G1) that
       actually has an X or Y coordinate will activate shifting.
       From that point on, all following XY moves are shifted.

    Why this works âœ…:
    - SuperSlicer typically inserts ';LAYER_CHANGE' just before it starts
      laying down the first layer of the actual model.
    - Purge lines before that comment are left unshifted, so the purge
      still happens at the origin.
    - After we hit the first "real" perimeter/infill move, we start shifting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_file : str
        Path to the merged, unshifted G-code (e.g. "<root>/<name>.gcode")
    out_file : str
        Path to write the shifted G-code (e.g. "<root>/<name>_moved.gcode")
    x_off, y_off : float or None
        Override XY shift in mm. If None, we read PIPELINE_CONFIG["final_shift_xy_mm"].

    Behavior is OS-independent. Paths are normalized using os.path.
